#PureFoundation

PureFoundation is a binary-compatible clone of the Foundation framework created exclusively for Darwin using Apple's open source Objective-C 2.0 runtime, AutoZone garbage collector and CFLite library. It's primary purpose is to support the PureDarwin effort to build a fully-functional Darwin distribution, by providing the support library which certain components require.

For installation instructions, see the wiki.

##Warning

PureFoundation is intended for use under Darwin only, to replicate functionality already present in OS X. Please please please do not even think about installing it on OS X. It is currently sub-alpha-class software and would cause many many bad things to happen.

## Introduction

PureFoundation is a clone of Apple's Foundation.framework. It is designed exclusively for use with Darwin, and uses CFLite and the Objective-C 2.0 runtime (and, one day, the AutoZone garbage collector). One side effect of this is binary compatibility with a subset of tools and applications compiled on OS X.

The primary goal of PureFoundation is to provide the features necessary to allow the creation of a self-contained Darwin system. Objective-C is a great programming language and Foundation is a mature and fully-featured programming library, so it's hardly surprising that Apple uses it extensively in the development of both OS X and Darwin. However, this has left us in the position where several key components released as open source as part of Darwin cannot run without Foundation, which hasn't been (and is unlikely ever to be) released as open source. The alternative to cloning Foundation is to re-write these components using another language and library.

### Hasn't this been done before?

There are already a number of open source projects which aim to achieve a similar goal. GNUStep and Cocotron are the most prominent of these. PureFoundation will certainly reuse some source code from each of these projects. PureFoundation, however, differs in that it starts by building on CFLite. This provides implementations of core library objects - collections, strings, OS abstractions - which are identical to those used by Apple, and also means development is much faster.

## PureFoundation and CFLite

To say that PureFoundation and CFLite are closely linked is an understatement. PureFoundation relies on CFLite for a large amount of its functionality (which sets this project apart from the likes of GNUStep or Cocotron), and in return the patched version of CFLite we use requires the PureFoundation version of Foundation.framework to be present. It is therefore probably fair to say that the PureFoundation project is as much about working on CFLite as it is about coding the objective-C framework.

The changes made to CFLite can be divided into 3 general categories.

### Restoring missing symbols

As [this page](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/wiki/CFLite) from the PureDarwin project illustrates, CFLite is lacking a great number of symbols which CoreFoundation exports. Some of these represent functionality removed from CFLite by Apple, while others are specific to Foundation. The presence of these is beneficial beyond this project to the wider Darwin effort, and therefore patches for these are usually handed-off to the PureDarwin project (see [here](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/wiki/Integrating_patches_and_additional_sources) for a discussion, and [here](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin) for the code).

These patches include restoring basic string constants (such as the NS...Locales and NS...Exceptions) and introducing dummy stubs for missing (this currently includes the CFNotificationCenter functions, but see below). They will probably be expanded in the near future, as we find more holes to fix. For instance, although PureFoundation now includes an implementation of NSGetSizeAndAlignment(), it appears that the linker expects to find it exported from CF. A thorough survey of what code needs to reside where is on the cards.

### Restoring missing functionality

There is a lot of CoreFoundation missing from CFLite. In some case, where Darwin components expect it (and recall that the primary goal of the PureFoundation project is to facilitate the running of a complete Darwin system with as little modification to individual component's source code as possible) our only real option is to restore that functionality.

One example of this was the somewhat obscure "serialise a binary plist via a write stream" issue which SystemConfiguration relied upon. In this case, the fix was (or at least appeared to be - there's still time for it to go hideously wrong) quite simple (2 lines of code). Reproducing CFNotificationCenter functions looks like it will be a little more difficult, although still perfectly achievable.

Where possible, we co-operate with the [OpenCFLite](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencflite/) project, donating fixes to them where practical.

### Restoring the bridge

Unlike the previous two categories, it's unlikely that patches produced in pursuit of restoring the Foundation-CFLite bridge will find a use outside of PureFoundation. This part of the project is pretty-much complete now.

### The future

Its likely that in the near future (say in a month's time - soon after the PureDarwin boys put out their next preview release, which PureFoundation would like to be a part of) we may shift to basing the patched CFLite off of OpenCFLite rather than directly from Apple's source. This should give us the advantage that aint least the patched discussed in "Restoring missing functionality" above will already be in-place and well-tested.

## Installing PureFoundation

The PureFoundation project consists of three components: the Foundation.framework, which reproduces the functionality of Apple's Foundation; a patched version of the open source CFLite, which supports Foundation and Darwin by exporting missing symbols; and ddistnoted, the distributed notification daemon. Each component relies on the other, so you will need to install both. However, the patches to CFLite shouldn't prevent it operating as normal for non-Foundation applications.

This section details installing the binaries. Instructions for building a patched CFLite from source can be found below.

PureFoundation has been tested with (and was developed using) the PureDarwin project's PureDarwinXmas, which is a VMWare image. These instructions assume that you are running this on a Mac, using VMWare Fusion.

* Download PureFoundation-0.xxx.root.zip (where xxx is the highest versions listed) from the [downloads page](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureFoundation/releases/tag/PureFoundation-0.0003.1) and un-archive it. For the rest of these instructions we'll assume the decompressed folders are in ~/Downloads/.
* Ensure that VMWare Fusion is not running. Find the puredarwinxmas.vmwarevm virtual machine file in the Finder. Right- (Command-) click on it and select "Show Package Contents". A new window will open. Double click on the file puredarwinxmas.vmdk. This is the virtual machine's disk image, which should now be mounted.
* You will probably want to move the existing CoreFoundation.framework somewhere safe, for if (when) something goes wrong. `mv /Volumes/PureDarwinXmas/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework /Volumes/PureDarwinXmas/Users/Shared` 
* Copy the frameworks into place. I suggest using ditto from the Terminal. (These exact commands are for the v0.003 release. Obviously, use the current version number.) `ditto ~/Downloads/PureFoundation-0.003.root/ /Volumes/PureDarwinXmas/`
* Unmount the disk image.
* Boot VMWare Fusion.
* Start making notes about everything which doesn't work.

## Building CFLite

If you just want to try out PureFoundation you'll probably be better off using the pre-compiled binaries available from the downloads page. Otherwise, read on.

CFLite is built using the darwinbuild script and environment, available from MacOSForge. It is always a good idea to be running the latest version pulled from svn, since new bug-fixes and enhancements are frequently added.

You should also be building using the [PureDarwin patches]((https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/wiki/Integrating_patches_and_additional_sources)), since these add common fixes which PureFoundation relies upon.

For the rest of this discussion we will assume that your `darwinbuild` path is `/Volumes/dbuf/9G55`. It doesn't matter if it isn't. The patch has been tested with `9F33` and `9G55`.

### Updating the PureDarwin patches

At the time of writing, it's necessary to update the patch file automatically downloaded from the PureDarwin project. When this is changed, these instructions will be removed. Until then...

* Run darwinbuild CF once, to ensure that the patch files are downloaded.
* Download the file `CF-476.15.CFBundle_Resources.p1.patch` from the downloads page.
* Copy the downloaded patch into the Sources directory, over-writing the PureDarwin patch of the same name. `cp ~/Downloads/http://code.google.com/p/purefoundation/downloads/list /Volumes/dbufs/9G55/Source/`

The updated patch will now be applied each time you build CF.

### Building the patched CFLite

* Change into the Source directory and un-tar the CFLite source tarball. `cd Sources/ ; tar xfvz CF-476.17.tar.gz`
* Download the latest PureFoundation patch from the downloads page. (At the time of writing this was `CF-476.15.pf6.patch`.) (Don't worry about the different CFLite version numbers - the source doesn't change that much between releases.)
* Change into the CFLite source directory and apply the patch. `cd CF-476.17/ ; patch -p1 -r . < ~/Downloads/CF-476.15.pf6.patch`
* Change back to the main darwinbuild directory and build CFLite. `cd ../.. ; darwinbuild CF`

darwinbuild will apply the PureDarwin patches to the patched source code.

## Building PureFoundation

PureFoundation is an XCode project. To build it, click on the little picture of a hammer.

PueFoundation in its current form is set-up to be developed and compiled in XCode on OS X and then copied across to the target machine. In part this is due to its reliance on Apple's Foundation headers, but it is also because I personally find working in XCode far easier and more productive than any of the alternatives. If it was for the ability to hit "build" every other line and have the compiler point out my stupid mistakes it's unlikely the project would have come this far.

### Apple's Foundation headers

PureFoundation is compiled using Apple's Foundation headers, but since these are copyrighted Apple material they are not (cannot be) distributed with the PureFoundation source. Instead, the XCode project includes references to the versions stored at `/System/Library/Frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers/`. If you are running XCode on OS X you will have access to these files.

### Skip install step

The "skip install step" option should be unchecked for all build configurations. It was on the version of the project I uploaded, anyway. You might like to just double-check that it still is. Installing PureFoundation in place of Foundation.framework on OS X would be... unwise.

### Linking

PureFoundation links against CoreFoundation.framework, so that on Darwin it will link to CFLite. (It also links to the objective-C runtime, and will likely someday also link to the CoreServices framework to get at CFNetwork.) However, the patched CFLite upon which PureFoundation relies at runtime exports a number of symbols which CoreFoundation doesn't. In order to shut the linker the hell up, PureFoundation passes it the "-undefined dynamic_lookup" flags. You should therefore be extra careful, as a typo may be missed at compile time and only show up when the Framework's in Darwin.

### Build configurations

PureFoundation has two build configurations defined: "Debug", which spews many many comments (such as the names of methods and functions as they are called) to the console, and "Relase", which doesn't. Debug also has the side-effect of killing the X server (at least under the VMWare frame buffer used in PureDarwinXmas).

### Building PureFoundation with darwinbuild

At the moment, building PureFoundation either with darwinbuild or in the darwinbuild chroot has not been attempted. To do so would probably require a new set of Foundation headers, since Apple's versions include other non-Darwin headers files (eg. NSGeometry includes headers from CoreGraphics).

## Bridging PureFoundation to CFLite

The main difference between PureFoundation and other Foundation/Cocoa clones (such as GNUStep or Cocotron) is that PureFoundation implements a bridge to the open-source CFLite in the same way that Apple's Foundation bridges to the full CoreFoundation. This section details how this was achieved, and some of the points you need to consider when developing PureFoundation. (When developing with PureFoundation you should treat it exactly as you would 'proper' Foundation.)

### Bridged classes

As of v0.0009 (5/3/09) the following CFLite types have been bridged to their Foundation equivalents: CFArray, CFCalendar, CFCharacterSet, CFData, CFDate, CFDictionary, CFError, CFLocale, CFNumber (and CFBoolean), CFReadStream, CFWriteStream, CFRunLoopTimer, CFSet, CFTimeZone and CFURL. (CFAttributedString is not supported by CFLite.)

### Bridging to CFLite

For the basics of bridging you can do far worse than reading [this](http://cocoadev.com/BridgingForFunAndProfit) discussion. The key to bridging is that CF type structures reserve room for the most important feature of objective-C objects: the isa pointer. This is a 4- (or under 64-bit, 8-) byte pointer at the start of the type/object data. This points to the class table for an object, and is used by the runtime to bind messages to the appropriate methods. Under CFLite, this is always set to 0. (Okay, almost always. The exception is for constant strings, which we'll mention a little later.)

In order to get the obj-C runtime to treat CFLite types as first-class objects, we're going to have to fill this with a pointer to the appropriate bridged class. Rummaging through the CFLite source code, we find that in a couple of places (most notably, in _CFRuntimeCreateInstance() in CFRuntime.c) this value is set to the return from __CFISAForTypeID(). This in turn is defined in CFInternal.h as a no-op, returning 0 no matter what. Luckily it is still correctly passed the CFTypeID wherever it appears in the code, so it's just a matter of replacing this with a function which returns a pointer to the relevant Class structure.

The other function which plays a key role in bridging is _CFRuntimeBridgeClasses(). This is also to be found in CFRuntime.c, and is also a no-op in CFLite. (You can still find a couple of calls to it, commented out, in the 476.17 source.) How exactly Apple handled the bridging is not clear, however, so if you check the patch you'll see we just cobbled-together a simple table of CFTypeID-Class pointer pairs. Not particularly elegant, but it works.

Calls to _CFRuntimeBridgeClasses() are made (mostly) during the __CFInitialize() function, as the types they bridge to are added to CFLite's runtime environment.

### Constant strings

Getting constant, compiler-created strings (@"these" and CFSTR("these")) to bridge had me puzzled for a while. The clue was that even while all other CFLite types had their class pointer set to 0, in constant strings this had another value. A blog post I've unfortunately lost track of finally pointed me towards the __CFConstantStringClassReference[] array (again, in CFRuntime.c). It is to this which the constant strings' isa points. By filling it with the same Class info as PureFoundation's own NSCFConstantString class it was able to inherit all of its behaviour. (We used a sub-class of the NSCFString class to short-circuit certain methods which wouldn't make sense if invoked on a constant object, such as adding them to an autorelease pool.)

### The bridged classes

Many classes in Cocoa (and before it NeXT/OpenStep) are described as class clusters: public front-ends to groups of opaque private classes. What this basically means is that even though you think you're creating (for instance) an NSString, what you actually get back is one of NSString's private subclasses (very often an NSCFString). This is how the magic of bridging happens. (It's also just as well, because NSString doesn't declare any extra ivars beyond its isa, and implementing a string store without any kind of storage is likely to be tricky.) Under PureFoundation, when you ask for an NSString, what you actually get back is a CFString with an isa set up to tell the obj-C runtime that it is an NSCFString. Without much effort proper OS X-style toll-free bridging is achieved: pass it into a CF function or send it an obj-C message, either way it will behave as expected.

One point to note is that there are no explicitly-mutable bridged classes. As far as CF is concerned, a CFString and a CFMutableString are exactly the same type (they even share the same type ID), with the only difference existing as a mutable flag tucked-away somewhere in their headers. This makes life both easier and harder for us. Our inheritance tree can be simplified for one thing. Inheritance simply runs: NSObject -> NSString -> NSMutableString -> NSCFString -> NSCFConstantString. But we still need to know whether the underlying CF type is mutable and whether we should allow code to invoke mutable-class methods. CF provides private functions for just this (eg. _CFStringIsMutable()), and a quick patch makes them available to PureFoundation.

Of the bridged classes, CFURL/NSCFURL is an anomaly. NSCFURL is not actually a CFURL type. Instead, it is an obj-C object which holds a reference to a CFURL type. This is what CFLite expects: it includes the code needed to send the NSCFURL object the private _cfurl message needed to return the CFURL type.

### Foundation vs. CoreFoundation

Even looking at the eviscerated CFLite source it's clear to see that as far as Apple is concerned Foundation wears the trousers in the Foundation-CoreFoundation marriage. Whenever possible, CF will despatch an obj-C message to fulfil a CF function rather than using its own code. Now, this is fine when you've got a well-developed obj-C library to call upon, but it's of absolutely no use to us. Luckily, all these message despatches are #defined as no-ops in the CFLite source.

In PureFoundation, CFLite is clearly in the driving seat, with CF functions used to satisfy almost all requests. The majority of the bridged classes' methods simply wrap CF function calls, checking and translating arguments on their way in and out. All bridged classes also use the CF retain/release mechanism. (This was adopted around v0.0009 of PureFoundation. Prior to that, all bridged classes used the obj-C retain/release mechanism... which lead to their deallocator functions never being called, resulting in a veritable plethora of seg faults and bus errors. The new way is better.)

All obj-C objects are also allocated from the default CF memory pool. It is hoped that this will magically bless them with garbage-collectability, although this has yet to be put to the test.

### Almost-bridged classes

CFLite is the gift that keeps on giving. In addition to the toll-free bridged types, it also provides a number of types which do things Foundation does, just not using the same objects. Among these are runloops, number formatters, and sockets. They all help to reduce the amount of work needed to replicate the functionality of Foundation.

## TODO

Yes, there's an awful lot to do. This file is for noting improvements which we could go back and apply to code we've already written.

* NSFileManager -- change attribute methods to call fstat64/lstat64, if possible, to retrieve eg. file creation date
* Collections -- expose setCapacity functions in CFLite and call them in the corresponding initWithCapacity: methods.
* NSArray -- sort with hint; NSIndexSet methods; NSSortDescriptor methods; URL methods
* NSDictionary -- keysSortedByValue; descriptions; URL methods
* NSCalendar -- auto-updating callendar
* NSError -- recovery options and recovery attempt
* NSLocale -- auto-updating locale; something needs to set the actual locale
* NSSet -- descriptions
* NSCountedSet -- everything (based on CFBag).
