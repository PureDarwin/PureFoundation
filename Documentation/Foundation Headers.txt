FOUNDATION HEADERS
==================

PureFoundation is built using the header files provided by Apple's own Foundation.framework. This ensure that PureFoundation will be compatible (in terms of publically-declared ivar layout) with any other application also compiled against these headers and linked to Foundation.

Apple's Foundation headers are copyright, and therefore cannot be distributed with PureFoundation. They also contain the occasional reference to other Apple-only headers (eg. NSGeometry.h references CoreGraphics). For this reason, in its current form, PureFoundation can only be built in XCode under OS X.

The PureFoundation XCode project includes Apple's Foundation headers by reference. In particular, it references the versions stored in /System/Library/frameworks/Foundation.framework/Headers.
